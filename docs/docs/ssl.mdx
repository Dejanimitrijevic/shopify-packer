Packer uses a local server which compiles and serves theme **JavaScript** and **CSS** locally.
By serving these assets locally, developers don't need to wait for them to be
uploaded to Shopify servers to preview the changes they are making.
When combined with Hot Module Reloading, developers see changes in their code reflected
almost instantly.

When SSL is not working your css/js will be blocked in the browser, and
the site will appear broken. You can also see the requests being blocked
in the network tab chrome developer tools. There are two methods for fixing this:

1. [Trusting the CA](#trusting-the-ca)

   This is the best solution and only needs to be done once

2. [Ignore SSL Warnings](#ignore-ssl-warnings)

   This is the fastest method but will often have to be repeated, also some MacOS users have issues with it.

:::note
Liquid files are not served locally and require uploading and refreshing the page. Packer handles this automatically.
:::

:::caution
For the local server to function properly you must have SSL setup properly.

## Trusting the CA

To permanently trust the certificate and avoid SSL issues long term you need to
tell your OS to trust the CA that issues your cert.
All future certificates issued by the CA will be trusted.
You can create the initial CA and cert manually using packer `ssl:make`, otherwise
packer will create when you run `start` if it doesn't exist.

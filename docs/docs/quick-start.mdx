For the local server to function properly you must have SSL setup properly.
See the docs on [HTTPS & SSL](ssl.mdx).

:::info Development mode

Developers wanting to share an instance of their store with other developers are
often confused when they see their store appear broken.
Because CSS and JavaScript are being served locally, your theme wonâ€™t function on any
machine other than the one the Express server is currently running on until your run deploy.
